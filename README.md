4. `v_DiscountVsSales` – Discount range vs sales quantity  
5. `v_MonthlySalesTrends` – Monthly revenue trends  
6. `v_MostProfitableProducts` – Highest revenue products  
7. `v_TotalSalesByPaymentMethod` – Revenue by payment method  
8. `v_RegionCategorySales` – Revenue by region–category

FROM Sales
JOIN Products ON Sales.product_id = Products.product_id
GROUP BY Products.product_name
ORDER BY Total_Quantity_Sold DESC;
